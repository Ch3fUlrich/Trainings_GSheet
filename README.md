# Trainings_GSheet
Here is a link to my google sheet for creating a trainings plan and tracking progress. 

[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mbxBgb6ONFcjXvvaiqutDBW2g89qG9e119b6y9SrxpA/edit?usp=sharing)

Explanation:
- all weights in kg
- Trainingsplan can be set by the checkboxes in column A

If 5x20 reached: 
- increase weight
else:
- add Sets until 100 Reps are reached

Max. 20 reps per set, because weights >60% of 1 rep max (1RM) are needed for muscle hypertrophy. Based on some calculations it is not possible to do more reps than 20 with weights of 60% 1RM

10-20 sets per week for significant hypertrophy compared to less sets
